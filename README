--------
Abstract
--------

POE::Component::Server::XMLRPC adds asynchronous, event driven
XMLRPC over HTTP to your POE applications.  It works very well
with synchronous XMLRPC::Lite clients, even.

-------
Example
-------

The example/ping-server script is a "personal ping proxy"
<http://philringnalda.com/blog/2003/03/allnewer_fast_again_weblogscom.php>
which takes a ping in the form needed by Weblogs.com and sends it
out to a list of ping servers.  This saves you the trouble and
aggrevation of pinging multiple servers.  Updates to the script
can be found at <http://openweblog.info/>.

------------
Requirements
------------

POE::Component::Server::XMLRPC requires the following modules,
each of which probably has its own requirements.

  POE::Component::Server::HTTP
  XMLRPC::Lite

It is recommended to use some installation utility such as CPANPLUS,
CPAN, or ActiveState's PPM to ensure that dependencies are included.

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

POE::Component::Server::XMLRPC may be installed through the CPAN shell
in the usual CPAN shell manner.  This typically is:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e 'intstall POE::Component::Server::XMLRPC'

You can also read this README from the CPAN shell:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
  cpan> readme POE::Component::Server::XMLRPC

And you can install the component from the CPAN prompt as well:

  cpan> install POE::Component::Server::XMLRPC

-------------------
Manual Installation
-------------------

This component may also be installed manually.
<ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/M/MA/MAHEX/> or a
similarly named directory at your favorite CPAN mirror should
hold the latest version.

Downloading and unpacking the distribution are left as exercises for
the reader.  To build and test it:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test

When you're ready to install the component:

  make install

Now it should be ready to use.

Thanks for reading!
